## Pytest Demo

This repository contains the code I demonstrated during my presentation at the January meeting of the [Austin Python Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/austinpython/events/205376942/).

Python 3 is required to run this code! To run, create a virtualenv and install the dependencies (the instructions assume Python 3 is installed and is your main Python):

```
pyvenv /path/to/my/env
source /path/to/my/env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# run the tests
py.test -v
```

The commit history in this repository mostly mirrors the sequence of changes I described in the [presentation slides](https://docs.google.com/a/containable.io/presentation/d/1VO3j8kYU3zqjsNnv0OLRCKIWDpWKfZbESvdB1X9Nde4).
